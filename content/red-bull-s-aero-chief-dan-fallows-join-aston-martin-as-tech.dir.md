Fallows will form part of triumvirate of technical leaders, joining Performance Director Tom McCullough and Engineering Director Luca Furbatto – who will move across [from Alfa Romeo at the end of the season](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.aston-martin-hire-new-engineering-director-and-promote-andrew-green-in-tech.43vUeM4ltCcZGb05gPIFSR.html) – with the three set to report to Aston Martin’s Chief Technical Officer Andrew Green.

Fallows joined Red Bull Racing in 2006 as their Team Leader in the aerodynamics department, becoming Head of Aerodynamics in 2014 following Red Bull’s dominant Sebastian Vettel-led era, which saw them win every drivers’ and constructors’ title between 2010 and 2013 – with Fallows now set to re-join Vettel at Aston Martin.

Red Bull said Fallows will not be departing until the conclusion of his contract "and remains fully focused on building upon the positive start we have made to the 2021 season."

*Fallows became Head of Aerodynamics at Red Bull in 2014*

Regarding the move, Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner said: “It goes without saying that Dan will be missed, as he has played an important role during his time at Red Bull Racing and I would like to thank him for his contribution towards the team’s successes.

> “We do however recognise that the chance to take on the role of Technical Director within a Formula 1 team is an appealing next step in his career. In turn, this move creates exciting internal progression opportunities as we look to the future and draw from the wealth of talent within the wider team.”

In terms of the timing of the move, Horner said it wouldn't be happening for some time. “Dan’s going to be with us for a while," he said. "He’s fully focussed on this year’s car and will be with us until the end of his contract.”

Asked when Fallows would be leaving Red Bull, Horner replied: “I’m not going to go into great details but it certainly won’t be within the next couple of years.”
